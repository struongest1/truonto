	<h3>Jimmy</h3>
	<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/jimmy.png" alt="" /></span><p>Jimmy has a MSc. in Chemical Engineering from the U of T. He spends his week working for the federal government in a remote, rural air monitoring station while studying the long-range transport of chemical contaminants into the Arctic. Jimmy has a green thumb and a 'thing' for jungle plants, compost and edible vegetables. A chemist by training, he brings his passion for mixing and concocting into the home by way of his recipes, odd projects and gardening. Jimmy is an aspiring polyglot working on his bilingual status â€“ he likes to listen to French radio and TV while dabbling in various other languages. He is into cross-country skiing, long walks in the woods, cooking, gardening, autolalia and conversations in the kitchen whilst making food. He has big dreams of sustainable living and self-sufficiency.

	Landlord and roommate, Jimmy has been renting the Ossington house for about 6 years. For him, the Oz is a personal project in community building and social experiment. He can be seen on occasion on weekends fixing a wall or doing some landscape on the property.

	<h3>Dano</h3>
	<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/dano.jpg" alt="" /></span>Dano has a MSc. in Neurophysiology from the U of T and has gotten himself a job with a startup building headsets for brain-computer interfaces. He's building software that processes and visualizes EEG data and is just as interested in JavaScript and "functional reactive programming" as he is about synaptic plasticity and ephaptic coupling. Generally, the intersection between neuroscience and tech is where Dano wants to be.</p>
	<p>Dano enjoys brewing beer, skiing, hiking and playing the occasional video game (curr: Breath of the Wild). He also sings and plays ukulele and guitar, sometimes at odd hours of the day. He enjoys gardening but does not have a green thumb, he just tries his best to be consistent with the watering. He cycles everywhere. Dano makes his presence felt in the house, but hopes that it is bouyant and joyful.</p>
