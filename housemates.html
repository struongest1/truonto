	</span>
	<p>Jimmy is a recent MSc. grad from the U of T. He spends his week working for the federal government in a remote, rural air
		monitoring station while studying the long-range transport of chemical contaminants into the Arctic. Jimmy has a green
		thumb and a 'thing' for jungle plants, compost and edible vegetables. A chemist by training, he brings his passion for
		mixing and concocting into the home by way of his recipes, odd projects and gardening. Jimmy is an aspiring polyglot working
		on his bilingual status – he likes to listen to French radio and TV while dabbling in various other languages. He is into
		cross-country skiing, long walks in the woods, cooking, gardening, autolalia and conversations in the kitchen whilst making
		food. He has big dreams of sustainable living and self-sufficiency. Landlord and roommate, Jimmy has been renting the Ossington
		house for about 6 years. For him, the Oz is a personal project in community building and social experiment. He can be seen
		on occasion on weekends fixing a wall or doing some landscape on the property.

		</span>Dano recently graduated with a MSc. in Neurophysiology from the U of T and has gotten himself a job in tech. He's building
		a desktop application for an EEG device company that will let researchers collect, analyze, and visualize EEG data from
		a wireless EEG headband. Generally, the intersection between neuroscience and tech is where Dano wants to be.</p>
	<p>Dano enjoys brewing beer, skiing, hiking and playing the occasional video game (curr: Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild). He also sings
		and plays ukulele and guitar, sometimes at odd hours of the day. Enjoys gardening but does not have a green thumb. Cycles
		everywhere. Dano makes his presence felt in the house, but hopes that it is bouyant and joyful.</p>
